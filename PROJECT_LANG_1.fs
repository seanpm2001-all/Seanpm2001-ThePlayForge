// I decided to make F# the main programming language for this project (Seanpm2001-ThePlayForge) as I want to make a pun off the name, since there isn't much else I can do with the contents of the project. Forge has an F in it, and the forge is sharp, so F# is the project language here. I can't do much else for a project language file, as this is an image/information project, and not a software/web application project.
